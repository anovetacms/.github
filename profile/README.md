# Panda is the CMS we always wanted. ✨ 

Better websites, on Rails.

We're building a CMS for 2024, with the modern technologies we love:

* Ruby on Rails 7, with ViewComponents
* Tailwind CSS
* One-Click Deploys

We're [Otaina](https://www.otaina.co.uk), a small group of freelancers. We needed something that could handle websites large and small – but where we could expand it too. We'll be sending the first websites live in March 2024.

We're building Panda in public. We welcome people who want to try it out, ideas, and contributions. In return, we'll try build something great – and remember, Matz is nice and so we are nice. 😊

Here's our initial roadmap:

* Quick installation and upgrades: install a Ruby gem and get going.
* Page management
* Menu management
* File management
* Analytics
* User management
* Quick deployment

We're expecting a "Pro" version will incorporate membership and community features. We'll offer a paid license for this. Hosting services, and pre-made themes, might join as additional services one day.

Pandas fall over and eat a lot. So do we. 🐼
